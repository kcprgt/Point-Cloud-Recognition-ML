**Object Classification in LIDAR Point Clouds**
This project focuses on developing and comparing methods based on machine learning models for object classification in point clouds from LIDAR scans. The following models are evaluated: Random Forest, XGBoost, PointNet, PointNet++, RandLa-Net.

**Data**
The dataset consists of four point clouds from topographic LIDAR scans of the Gda≈Ñsk area. Each point is labeled with one of the following classes: Never Classified, Ground, Low Vegetation, Medium Vegetation, High Vegetation, Building, Noise, Water.

**Goal**
The aim is to assess the performance of traditional machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) and deep learning architectures (PointNet, PointNet++, RandLa-Net) in classifying objects in point cloud data.
